We are a startup founded in 2017 looking to corner a number of niche markets in the ITSM, Discovery and Monitoring space.

Unlike traditional enterprise software houses, our target market is to individuals like developers, consultants and managers offering unique free and low cost apps to better enable them for agility in their work environment, be it home, office or client site.

Traversys does however have it’s roots in traditional consultancy  and enterprise and we have the ability to leverage these skills to the corporate customer when required.

We offer apps, integrations, development, training and consultancy at a decent price. But above all we offer flexibility and results. Get in touch with the team today to see how we can help you bridge whatever gaps you’re facing.
